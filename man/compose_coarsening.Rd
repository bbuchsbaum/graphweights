\title{Compose Two Coarsening Passes}
\usage{
compose_coarsening(pass1, pass2)
}
\arguments{
\item{pass1}{A list containing `C`, `W_c`, `L_c`, and `mapping` from the first coarsening pass.}

\item{pass2}{A list containing `C`, `W_c`, `L_c`, and `mapping` from the second coarsening pass.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
  \item{C_final}{The final coarsening matrix mapping from the original graph to the final coarsened graph.}
  \item{W_c_final}{The final coarsened adjacency matrix.}
  \item{L_c_final}{The final coarsened Laplacian matrix.}
  \item{mapping_final}{An integer vector mapping original vertices directly to the final coarsened vertices.}
}
}
\description{
Given the results of two consecutive passes of the REC coarsening, this function composes
them to produce a single equivalent coarsening mapping and corresponding coarsened matrices.
}
\examples{
# Suppose you have run:
# result1 <- rec_coarsen(W, T=..., ...)
# result2 <- rec_coarsen(result1$W_c, T=..., ...)
# Now compose:
# composed_result <- compose_coarsening(result1, result2)
