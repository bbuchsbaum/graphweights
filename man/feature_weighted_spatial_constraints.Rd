\arguments{
\item{coords}{The spatial coordinates as a matrix with rows as objects and columns as dimensions.}

\item{feature_mats}{A list of feature matrices, one for each data block.}

\item{sigma_within}{The bandwidth of the within-block smoother. Default is 5.}

\item{wsigma_within}{The bandwidth of the within-block feature weights. Default is 0.73.}

\item{wsigma_between}{The bandwidth of the between-block feature weights. Default is 0.73.}

\item{alpha_within}{The scaling factor for within-block feature weights. Default is 0.5.}

\item{alpha_between}{The scaling factor for between-block feature weights. Default is 0.5.}

\item{shrinkage_factor}{The amount of shrinkage towards the spatial block average. Default is 0.1.}

\item{nnk_within}{The maximum number of nearest neighbors for within-block smoother. Default is 27.}

\item{nnk_between}{The maximum number of nearest neighbors for between-block smoother. Default is 27.}

\item{maxk_within}{The maximum number of nearest neighbors for within-block computation. Default is `nnk_within`.}

\item{variable_weights}{A vector of per-variable weights. Default is a vector of ones with length equal to the product of the number of columns in the `coords` matrix and the length of `feature_mats`.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean indicating whether to print progress messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A sparse matrix representing the feature-weighted spatial constraints for the provided data blocks.
}
\description{
This function creates a sparse matrix of feature-weighted spatial constraints for a set of data blocks. The feature-weighted spatial constraints matrix is useful in applications like image segmentation and analysis, where both spatial and feature information are crucial for identifying different regions in the image.
}
\section{Details}{

The function computes within-block and between-block constraints based on the provided coordinates, feature matrices, and other input parameters. It balances the within-block and between-block constraints using a shrinkage factor, and normalizes the resulting matrix by the first eigenvalue. The function also takes into account the weights of the variables in the provided feature matrices.
