\title{Compute node density for neighbor_graph object}
\usage{
\method{node_density}{neighbor_graph}(x, X, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A neighbor_graph object.}

\item{X}{A data matrix containing the data points, with rows as observations.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the node densities.
}
\description{
Compute the node density for a neighbor_graph object based on local neighborhoods.
}
\details{
Node density is computed as the average squared distance from each node to its neighbors,
normalized by the square of the neighborhood size.

# Create example data and graph

adj_matrix <- Matrix::Matrix(diag(10), sparse = TRUE)
ng <- neighbor_graph(adj_matrix)
