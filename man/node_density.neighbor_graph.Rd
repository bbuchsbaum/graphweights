\title{Node Density for neighbor_graph Objects}
\usage{
node_density.neighbor_graph(x, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A neighbor_graph object}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows represent data points and columns represent features}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the computed density for each node
}
\description{
Computes the local density around each node based on the distances to its neighbors
in the feature space.
}
\details{
For each node i, computes the average squared Euclidean distance to its neighbors,
normalized by the square of the number of neighbors. This provides a measure of
how densely packed the neighborhood is in the feature space.

The density for node i is computed as:
d_i = 1/(k_i^2) * sum((x_j - x_i)^2) for all neighbors j
where:
* k_i is the number of neighbors of node i
* x_i is the feature vector of node i
* x_j are the feature vectors of the neighbors
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create data matrix
X <- matrix(rnorm(50), 10, 5)

# Create neighbor graph
g <- make_ring(10)
ng <- neighbor_graph(g)

# Compute node densities
densities <- node_density(ng, X)
}
