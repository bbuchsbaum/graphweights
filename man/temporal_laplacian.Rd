\title{Compute Temporal Laplacian Matrix}
\usage{
temporal_laplacian(
  time,
  weight_mode = c("heat", "binary"),
  sigma = 1,
  window = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{A numeric vector representing time points. Values should be ordered
and typically represent equally spaced time intervals.}

\item{weight_mode}{Character string specifying the weighting scheme:
* "heat": Gaussian heat kernel weights (exponential decay with distance)
* "binary": Binary weights (1 for points within window, 0 otherwise)
Default is "heat".}

\item{sigma}{Numeric value controlling the width of the Gaussian kernel when
weight_mode = "heat". Larger values create broader temporal connections.
Only used when weight_mode = "heat". Default is 1.}

\item{window}{Integer specifying the size of the temporal window. Determines
how many adjacent time points are connected. Must be >= 1. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A sparse symmetric Matrix object representing the temporal Laplacian.
  The matrix has dimensions length(time) x length(time). The Laplacian
  has special spectral properties useful for various analyses:
  * It is positive semi-definite
  * Its eigenvalues provide information about the temporal structure
  * The smallest non-zero eigenvalue indicates temporal connectivity
}
\description{
Constructs a temporal Laplacian matrix from a time series, representing the
difference between the degree matrix and the adjacency matrix. This matrix
captures the temporal structure and can be used for various time series
analysis tasks.
}
\details{
The temporal Laplacian is computed as L = D - A, where:
* D is the diagonal degree matrix (row sums of adjacency matrix)
* A is the temporal adjacency matrix

The Laplacian matrix is useful for:
* Temporal clustering
* Dimensionality reduction
* Signal processing
* Pattern detection in time series

The structure of the Laplacian depends on the chosen weight mode and parameters
used to construct the underlying adjacency matrix.

# Create evenly spaced time points
