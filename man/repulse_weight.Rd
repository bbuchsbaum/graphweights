\title{Compute Repulsion Weight Between Feature Vectors}
\usage{
repulse_weight(x1, x2, sigma = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Numeric vector representing the first feature vector}

\item{x2}{Numeric vector representing the second feature vector}

\item{sigma}{Numeric smoothing parameter (default: 10)}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1/sigma representing the repulsion weight
}
\description{
Computes a repulsion weight between two feature vectors, where the weight
decreases as the distance between vectors increases, normalized by their magnitudes.
}
\details{
The repulsion weight is computed as:
w = 1 / (sigma + ||x1 - x2||^2 / (||x1|| + ||x2||))
where:
* ||x1 - x2|| is the Euclidean distance between vectors
* ||x1||, ||x2|| are the L2 norms of the vectors
* sigma is a smoothing parameter

This weight function has the following properties:
* Decreases with increasing distance between vectors
* Normalized by vector magnitudes to reduce scale sensitivity
* Bounded between 0 and 1/(sigma)
