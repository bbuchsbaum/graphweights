\title{GraphZoom Main Function with Optional Direct Feature Graph}
\usage{
graph_zoom(
  A,
  X = NULL,
  A_feat = NULL,
  levels = 2,
  t = 10,
  kNN = 10,
  beta = 1,
  embed_dim = 16,
  filter_power = 2,
  sigma = 0.001,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Sparse adjacency matrix (N x N) of the original graph topology.}

\item{X}{Node feature matrix (N x K). If NULL, no fusion from features is done unless A_feat is provided.}

\item{A_feat}{Optional precomputed feature graph (N x N). If provided, used directly for fusion.}

\item{levels}{Number of coarsening levels.}

\item{t}{Dimension for local spectral embedding during coarsening.}

\item{kNN}{Number of nearest neighbors for feature-based kNN (ignored if A_feat is given).}

\item{beta}{Weight to balance topology and feature graph in fusion.}

\item{embed_dim}{Dimension of embeddings at coarsest level.}

\item{filter_power}{The power k in Eq.(7) for refinement.}

\item{sigma}{Self-loop factor in refinement filter.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A list:
\item{E_original}{Refined embeddings for the original graph (N x embed_dim).}
\item{graphs}{List of graphs from level 0 to level L (fused and coarsened).}
\item{H_list}{List of mapping operators.}
\item{E_coarse}{Embeddings at the coarsest level.}
}
\description{
Perform GraphZoom pipeline as described in the paper.

If `A_feat` is provided, it will be used directly for graph fusion instead of computing
a feature graph from X. If both `A_feat` and `X` are provided, `A_feat` takes precedence.

\examples{
library(Matrix)
library(RcppHNSW)
set.seed(42)
N <- 100
A <- rsparsematrix(N, N, 0.01)
A <- (A + t(A))/2
diag(A) <- 0
X <- matrix(rnorm(N*20), nrow=N, ncol=20)
# Run with computed feature graph:
result <- graph_zoom(A, X, levels=2, embed_dim=8, kNN=5)

# If you have your own A_feat:
# Suppose A_feat is a NxN matrix you constructed from features externally:
# result <- graph_zoom(A, A_feat=my_feature_graph, levels=2, embed_dim=8)

E <- result$E_original
