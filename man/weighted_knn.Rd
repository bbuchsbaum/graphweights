\title{Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors}
\usage{
weighted_knn(
  X,
  k = 5,
  FUN = heat_kernel,
  type = c("normal", "mutual", "asym"),
  as = c("igraph", "sparse"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data matrix where rows are instances and columns are features.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider (default: 5).}

\item{FUN}{A kernel function used to convert Euclidean distances into similarities (default: heat_kernel).}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of k-nearest neighbors graph to compute. One of "normal", "mutual", or "asym" (default: "normal").}

\item{as}{A character string specifying the format of the output. One of "igraph" or "sparse" (default: "igraph").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the nearest neighbor search function (Rnanoflann::nn).}
}
\value{
If 'as' is "igraph", an igraph object representing the weighted k-nearest neighbors graph.
        If 'as' is "sparse", a sparse adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
This function computes a weighted k-nearest neighbors graph or adjacency matrix from a data matrix.
The function takes into account the Euclidean distance between instances and applies a kernel function
to convert the distances into similarities.

\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 10), 10, 10)
w <- weighted_knn(X, k = 5)
