\usage{
\method{neighbor_graph}{nn_searcher}(
  x,
  query = NULL,
  k = 5,
  type = c("normal", "asym", "mutual"),
  transform = c("heat", "binary", "euclidean", "normalized", "cosine", "correlation"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A nn_searcher object}

\item{query}{Optional query points}

\item{k}{Number of neighbors per node}

\item{type}{Character string specifying graph type}

\item{transform}{Character string specifying similarity transformation}

\item{sigma}{Scaling parameter for heat kernel}
}
\value{
A neighbor_graph object
}
\description{
Creates a neighbor graph from nearest neighbor search results with various
graph types and similarity transformations.
}
\details{
Available graph types:
* normal: Regular directed graph
* asym: Asymmetric directed graph
* mutual: Mutual nearest neighbor graph

Similarity transformations:
* heat: Heat kernel
* binary: Binary weights
* euclidean: Raw distances
* normalized: Normalized distances
* cosine: Cosine similarity
* correlation: Correlation coefficient
}
\examples{
# Create neighbor graph from iris dataset
data(iris)
X <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])
searcher <- nnsearcher(X)

# Create different types of graphs
g1 <- neighbor_graph(searcher, k = 5, type = "normal", transform = "heat")
g2 <- neighbor_graph(searcher, k = 5, type = "mutual", transform = "binary")
