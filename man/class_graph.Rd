\title{Construct a Class Graph}
\usage{
class_graph(labels, sparse = TRUE, self_connections = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{A vector of class labels that will be converted to factors if not already.}

\item{sparse}{Logical; whether to use sparse matrices in the computation. Default is TRUE.
Using sparse matrices can significantly reduce memory usage for large datasets.}

\item{self_connections}{Logical; whether to include self-connections (diagonal elements set to 1).
Default is FALSE, following standard graph theory conventions.}
}
\value{
A `class_graph` object, which is a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item{adjacency}{A matrix representing the adjacency structure of the graph.}
  \item{params}{A list of parameters used in graph construction.}
  \item{labels}{A vector of class labels.}
  \item{class_indices}{A list of vectors containing indices for each class.}
  \item{class_freq}{A table of class frequencies.}
  \item{levels}{A vector of unique class labels.}
  \item{classes}{Character string "class_graph" indicating the object type.}
}
}
\description{
Creates a graph structure where edges connect members of the same class. This is useful
for various machine learning tasks where class relationships need to be preserved.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple class graph from iris dataset
data(iris)
labels <- iris$Species

# Without self-connections (default)
cg <- class_graph(labels)

# With self-connections
cg_self <- class_graph(labels, self_connections = TRUE)

}
