\title{Get Weights of Neighboring Vertices}
\usage{
adjacency(x, ...)

adjacency(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object representing nearest neighbors.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{i}{The vertex or vertices for which to find the neighbor weights.}
}
\value{
A list where each element contains the weights of neighbors for the 
        corresponding input vertex.

An adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
Retrieves the weights of all neighbors for a specified set of nodes in a graph.
}
\examples{
# Create a weighted neighbor graph
w <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0), nrow = 3)
g <- neighbor_graph(w)

# Get neighbor weights for vertex 1
weights <- adjacency(g, 1)

# Create an object representing nearest neighbors
nn <- nnsearcher()

# Create adjacency matrix
adj <- adjacency(nn)
