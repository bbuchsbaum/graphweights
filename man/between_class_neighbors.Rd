\title{Between-Class Neighbors}
\usage{
between_class_neighbors(x, ng, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object.}

\item{ng}{A neighbor graph object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific methods.}
}
\value{
An object representing the between-class neighbors of the input graph, the structure of which depends on the input object's class.
}
\description{
A generic function to compute the between-class neighbors of a graph.

\examples{
# Create an example graph
g <- neighbor_graph(make_ring(5))

# Compute between-class neighbors
between_n <- between_class_neighbors(g, ng)
