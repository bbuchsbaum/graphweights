\title{Expand Label Similarities Using a Pre-computed Similarity Matrix}
\usage{
expand_label_similarity(labels, sim_mat, threshold = 0, above = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{Vector of categorical labels to expand relationships for}

\item{sim_mat}{Pre-computed similarity matrix between unique labels.
Row and column names must match the unique values in \code{labels}}

\item{threshold}{Numeric threshold for filtering similarities (default: 0)}

\item{above}{Logical; if TRUE keep similarities above threshold,
if FALSE keep those below (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A sparse symmetric Matrix object where entry (i,j) represents the
  expanded similarity between labels[i] and labels[j]
}
\description{
Expands categorical label relationships using a pre-computed similarity matrix,
creating a sparse similarity graph that captures complex relationships between
labels. This function is particularly useful for semi-supervised learning and
transfer learning scenarios where you have prior knowledge about label relationships.
}
\details{
This function maps categorical labels to a similarity space defined by a pre-computed
similarity matrix. It's particularly useful when:
* Labels have hierarchical relationships (e.g., taxonomies)
* Labels have continuous similarity scores (e.g., word embeddings)
* You want to incorporate domain knowledge into label relationships

Common use cases:
* Hierarchical classification with taxonomy relationships
* Text classification using word embedding similarities
* Transfer learning incorporating domain knowledge
* Semi-supervised learning with label propagation

Performance characteristics:
* Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of unique labels
* Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of non-zero similarities
* Most efficient when the similarity matrix is sparse

\examples{
# Example with hierarchical categories
categories <- c("animal", "mammal", "cat", "dog", "plant", "tree")
n <- length(categories)

# Create a similarity matrix based on hierarchy
sim_mat <- matrix(0, n, n)
colnames(sim_mat) <- rownames(sim_mat) <- categories

# Define hierarchical relationships
sim_mat["mammal", "animal"] <- sim_mat["animal", "mammal"] <- 0.8
sim_mat["cat", "mammal"] <- sim_mat["mammal", "cat"] <- 0.9
sim_mat["dog", "mammal"] <- sim_mat["mammal", "dog"] <- 0.9
sim_mat["tree", "plant"] <- sim_mat["plant", "tree"] <- 0.9

# Sample data with these categories
labels <- c("cat", "dog", "tree", "plant", "animal")

# Expand similarities
expanded <- expand_label_similarity(labels, sim_mat, threshold = 0.5)
