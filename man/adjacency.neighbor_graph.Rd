\title{Adjacency Matrix for neighbor_graph Objects}
\usage{
\method{adjacency}{neighbor_graph}(x, attr = "weight")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A neighbor_graph object}

\item{attr}{A character string specifying the edge attribute to use as weights
(default: "weight")}
}
\value{
A sparse Matrix object representing the adjacency matrix where:
  * Non-zero entries indicate edges
  * Values correspond to edge weights (if weighted)
  * The matrix is symmetric for undirected graphs
}
\description{
Extracts the adjacency matrix representation from a neighbor_graph object,
optionally using a specific edge attribute for weights.
}
\details{
The adjacency matrix represents the graph structure where each entry (i,j)
indicates the presence and weight of an edge between vertices i and j.
For unweighted graphs, non-zero entries are 1. For weighted graphs,
the entries correspond to the specified edge attribute.
