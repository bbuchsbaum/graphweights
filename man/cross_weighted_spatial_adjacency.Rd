\arguments{
\item{coord_mat1}{the first coordinate matrix (the query)}

\item{coord_mat2}{the second coordinate matrix (the reference)}

\item{feature_mat1}{the first feature matrix}

\item{feature_mat2}{the second feature matrix}

\item{wsigma}{the sigma for the feature heat kernel}

\item{alpha}{the mixing weight for the spatial distance (1=all spatial weighting, 0=all feature weighting)}

\item{nnk}{the maximum number of spatial nearest neighbors to include}

\item{maxk}{the maximum number of neighbors to include within spatial window}

\item{dthresh}{the threshold for the spatial distance}

\item{normalized}{whether to normalize the rows to sum to 1}
