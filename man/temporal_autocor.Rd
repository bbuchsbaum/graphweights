\title{Compute Temporal Autocorrelation Matrix}
\usage{
temporal_autocor(X, window = 3, inverse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows represent observations and columns represent
time points. Each row should contain a separate time series.}

\item{window}{Integer specifying the window size for computing autocorrelation.
Must be greater than 1 and less than the number of columns in X. Controls how
many time lags to consider. Default is 3.}

\item{inverse}{Logical indicating whether to compute the inverse of the correlation
matrix using shrinkage estimation. This can be useful when the correlation
matrix is ill-conditioned. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A sparse symmetric Matrix object representing the temporal autocorrelation.
  The matrix has dimensions ncol(X) x ncol(X), where element (i,j) represents
  the average correlation between time points i and j within the specified window.
}
\description{
Computes the temporal autocorrelation matrix of a multivariate time series using
a sliding window approach. The function can optionally compute the inverse
correlation matrix using shrinkage estimation.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Computes the correlation matrix of the input data
2. Optionally inverts the correlation matrix using shrinkage estimation
3. Constructs a band sparse matrix where each band represents correlations
   at different time lags up to the specified window size

The resulting matrix captures the temporal dependencies in the data at different
time lags, which can be useful for time series analysis, signal processing,
and temporal pattern recognition.

# Generate example multivariate time series data
n_series <- 10
n_timepoints <- 20
X <- matrix(rnorm(n_series * n_timepoints), 
           nrow = n_series, 
           ncol = n_timepoints)

# Compute temporal autocorrelation with window size 3
autocor <- temporal_autocor(X, window = 3)

# Compute inverse temporal autocorrelation
inv_autocor <- temporal_autocor(X, window = 3, inverse = TRUE)
