\usage{
design_kernel(
  factors,
  terms = NULL,
  rho = NULL,
  include_intercept = TRUE,
  rho0 = 1e-08,
  basis = c("cell", "effect"),
  contrasts = NULL,
  block_structure = NULL,
  normalize = c("none", "unit_trace", "unit_fro", "max_diag"),
  jitter = 1e-08
)
}
\arguments{
\item{factors}{A named list, one entry per factor, e.g.
list(A=list(L=5,type="nominal"), B=list(L=5,type="ordinal", l=1.5)). For
ordinal, supply length-scale l (>0). Supported types: "nominal", "ordinal",
"circular" (wrap-around distances).}

\item{terms}{A list of character vectors; each character vector lists factor
names that participate in that term. Examples: list("A", "B", c("A","B"))
for main A, main B, A:B. If NULL, defaults to all singletons (main effects)
and the full interaction.}

\item{rho}{A named numeric vector of nonnegative weights for each term (names
like "A", "B", "A:B"). If NULL, defaults to 1 for each term. Use rho0 for
the identity term (see below).}

\item{include_intercept}{Logical; if TRUE, adds rho0 * I to K (small ridge /
identity term).}

\item{rho0}{Nonnegative scalar weight for the identity term; default 1e-8.}

\item{basis}{Either "cell" (default) or "effect". If "effect", you must
supply `contrasts`.}

\item{contrasts}{A named list of contrast matrices for each factor, with
dimensions L_i x d_i. For example: list(A = contr.sum(5), B = contr.sum(5)).
You can also pass orthonormal Helmert.}

\item{block_structure}{If basis="effect", a character vector naming the
sequence of effect blocks to include, e.g., c("A","B","A:B"). If NULL,
inferred from `terms` and `contrasts`.}

\item{normalize}{One of c("none","unit_trace","unit_fro","max_diag").}

\item{jitter}{Small diagonal added to ensure SPD; default 1e-8.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
  \item{K}{PSD kernel matrix in the requested basis (cell or effect)}
  \item{K_cell}{The cell-space kernel matrix (always returned)}
  \item{info}{A list containing levels, factor_names, term_names, basis, map
    (T matrix for effect basis), blocks}
}
\description{
Constructs a positive semi-definite (PSD) kernel K over design regressors
that encodes factorial similarity: same level similarity, optional smoothness
across ordinal levels, and interaction structure via Kronecker composition.
Works either directly in cell space (one regressor per cell) or in
effect-coded space (main effects, interactions), by pulling K back
through user-specified contrast matrices.
}
\details{
The kernel is constructed using the following principles:
\itemize{
  \item For each factor i with L_i levels, define a per-factor kernel K_i (nominal or ordinal)
  \item For any term S (subset of factors), construct a term kernel by Kronecker product:
        K_S = kronecker(K_i, K_j, ...) for i,j in S and kronecker with J matrices for factors not in S
  \item Combine term kernels with nonnegative weights rho[S] and optionally add a small ridge
  \item If using effect coding, map the cell kernel to effect-space: K_effect = T' K_cell T
