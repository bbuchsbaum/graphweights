\title{Neighbor Graph for igraph Objects}
\usage{
\method{neighbor_graph}{igraph}(x, params = list(), type = NULL, classes = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An igraph object representing the graph structure}

\item{params}{A list of parameters used in graph construction (default: empty list)}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of graph (optional)}

\item{classes}{A character vector specifying additional classes to be added to
the object (optional)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be stored in the neighbor_graph object}
}
\value{
A neighbor_graph object with the following components:
  * G: The underlying igraph object
  * params: List of parameters used in graph construction
  * Additional components specified via ...
}
\description{
Creates a neighbor_graph object from an existing igraph object, providing a consistent
interface for graph-based operations in the graphweights package.
}
\details{
The neighbor_graph class provides a unified interface for working with neighborhood
relationships in graph structures. This constructor creates a neighbor_graph from
an existing igraph object, preserving its structure while adding functionality
specific to neighborhood-based operations.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a simple igraph object
library(igraph)
g <- make_ring(10)

# Convert to neighbor_graph
ng <- neighbor_graph(g)
