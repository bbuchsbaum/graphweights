\title{Heat Kernel Function}
\usage{
heat_kernel(x, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or matrix of distances between points}

\item{sigma}{Positive numeric value specifying the bandwidth parameter (default: 1).
Larger values result in slower decay of similarity with distance.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or matrix of the same dimensions as x containing the computed
  heat kernel values in the range [0,1].
}
\description{
Computes the heat kernel, which is a radial basis function commonly used in machine learning
and graph-based algorithms. The heat kernel measures similarity between points based on
their Euclidean distance, with a bandwidth parameter controlling the scale of similarity.
}
\details{
The heat kernel is defined as:
\deqn{K(x) = exp(-x^2/(2\sigma^2))}
where x is the distance between points and \eqn{\sigma} is the bandwidth parameter.
The kernel assigns higher values to points that are closer together and lower values
to points that are further apart, with the rate of decay controlled by sigma.
}
\examples{
# Simple example with a sequence of distances
x <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 100)
y <- heat_kernel(x, sigma = 1)
plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Heat Kernel", xlab = "Distance", ylab = "Similarity")

# Example with a distance matrix
X <- matrix(rnorm(20), ncol = 2)
D <- as.matrix(dist(X))
K <- heat_kernel(D, sigma = 0.5)
